## Overview

The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program rewards acute care hospitals with incentive payments for the quality of care provided in the inpatient hospital setting. These rewards are based on the quality of care delivered, aiming to enhance patient outcomes and overall healthcare quality.

## Importance of the Hospital VBP Program

- **Improves Quality of Care**: Ensures better care quality for hospital patients.
- **Enhances Patient Experience**: Hospitals strive to create a better experience for patients.
- **Reduces Adverse Events**: Helps to eliminate or reduce healthcare errors resulting in patient harm.
- **Promotes Evidence-Based Care**: Encourages hospitals to adopt evidence-based care standards and protocols for optimal outcomes, particularly for Medicare patients.
- **Incentivizes Improvement**: Provides incentives for hospitals to enhance patient experience.
- **Increases Transparency**: Boosts transparency of care quality for consumers, clinicians, and others.
- **Rewards High-Quality, Cost-Effective Care**: Recognizes hospitals that provide high-quality care at a lower cost to Medicare.

## Measures Used in the Hospital VBP Program

Hospitals are scored based on the following measures:

- **Clinical Outcomes**
- **Person and Community Engagement**
- **Patient Safety**
- **Efficiency and Cost Reduction**

## Questions of Investigation

1. Which state has the best hospital based on the performance of their VBP score?
2. Are the variables of the VBP score correlated to the outcome score?
3. Is the Person and Community Engagement variable related to the other variables on the VBP score?
4. How do the variables of the VBP score behave depending on the hospital's ownership?
5. Are state-census variables like population size, per capita income, and poverty influencing the scores of VBP-evaluated hospitals?
6. Based on the VBP score, where are the best hospitals in the United States?

## Resources

To further understand the Hospital VBP Program and access relevant data, refer to the following resources:

- [CMS.gov - Hospital Value-Based Purchasing](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/Value-Based-Programs/HVBP/Hospital-Value-Based-Purchasing)
- [Data.Medicare.gov - Hospital Compare](https://data.medicare.gov/)
- [AHRQ.gov - Patient Safety and Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov/topics/patient-safety-and-quality.html)
- [HealthData.gov - Hospital General Information](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/hospital-general-information)
- [United States Census Bureau API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)

The Census API was utilized to gather state-census variables such as population size, per capita income, and poverty levels. By leveraging these resources, we aim to answer our investigative questions and provide insightful analysis on the performance of hospitals under the VBP Program.
